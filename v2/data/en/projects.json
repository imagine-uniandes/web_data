When manually piloting a drone, there is a risk that the pilot will not cover the entire structure and miss extremely important information. A system is proposed based on the existence of a three-dimensional model of the structure to be inspected, where the user inspector only has to enter some basic parameters and a drone is able to execute the inspection task automatically.",

Given this, the big question that arises is what about if model performance is not the unique requirement to be fulfilled?  To address this, two new sub-fields of research have been proposed to help users to interact and understand ML models, and by this opening the black-box Interactive ML and Interpretable ML. This master thesis project is developed in the context of these sub-fields, with applications to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) supported by the t-SNE algorithm, a common technique for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. The contributions of this project are (1) provide a set of guidelines for designing more user-centric ML systems in terms of interactivity and interpretability and (2) design and develop of a visual tool to interact and interpret t-SNE models for performing EDA. The proposal is evaluated in two case studies, the animals dataset and the urban environment dataset from SALURBAL project.",

    "description": "We present Adaptic, a novel haptic device that can reconfigure itself to provide a physical proxy for a range of virtual objects in virtual reality (VR) applications. Adaptic provides the benefits of shape changing devices and relies on visual dominance in VR to serve as a general-purpose prop. In addition, we situate our novel hybrid haptic device in the context of haptic retargeting, a technique that redirects the user’s hand to provide haptic feedback for several virtual objects within their arm reach using only one shape-changing, physical device. We conducted a 4x2x10 within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to evaluate effectiveness and overall experience of using Adaptic compared to non-matching proxy objects (i.e., Styrofoam balls) and matching 3D printed shapes. Our results indicate that the Adaptic’s performance was comparable to other props without haptic retargeting in terms of completion time, position error, and angle error. Moreover, we found that users felt they were manipulating several virtual objects with only one Adaptic. Our major contributions include design considerations and a hardware implementation of our prototype.",

In this study, we investigate learning and the quality of the classroom experience by conducting classes in four metaverse environments: Workrooms, Spatial, Mozilla Hubs, and Arthur. Through the analysis of questionnaires, we assess the influence of factors such as avatars, spatial arrangement, mobility, and extra functionalities on concentration, usability, presence, and learning. While we did not observe significant differences in learning outcomes, our analysis reveals substantial variations in the quality of the classroom experience. Specifically, higher levels of immersion, concentration, and presence were observed in metaverses with limited movement and functionalities. Also, our findings emphasize the positive impact of avatars with realistic facial expressions on enhancing the overall learning experience. Finally, we present lessons learned and offer recommendations for class configurations in the metaverse based on our questionnaire analysis.",

In these spaces, the medical team can interact with the objects present in the environment, define roles and make decisions that help acquire skills and develop abilities to perform a neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure. Additionally, the project seeks to take advantage of the potential of virtual reality to generate realistic situations in which a newborn has difficulty initiating and maintaining an effective respiratory pattern. In this way, the user is allowed to enter the context and feel like they are in a real case so that they take ownership of their role and learn in the process. The above contributes to the training and capacity building of health personnel, so that, in a real situation, in which the circumstances recreated in the simulator are presented, they can act in a coordinated, assertive and efficient manner.",

However, in these studies, subjects could walk naturally across large tracking areas, or researchers provided them with large- immersive displays. Unfortunately, these configurations are far from current consumer-oriented VEs (COVEs), and little is known about how their limitations influence this task. Using a triangle completion paradigm, we assessed the subjects' spatial performance when developing path integration tasks in two consumer-oriented displays (an HTC Vive and a GearVR) and two consumer-oriented interaction devices (a Virtuix Omni motion platform and a Touchpad Control). Our results show that when locomotion is available (motion platform condition), there exist significant effects regarding the display and the path. In contrast, when locomotion is mediated no effect was found. Some future research directions are therefore proposed.",

This emerging field has various investigations which are briefly mentioned in order to get an idea of what is currently done and how. In this order of ideas, experts on the field, through this brief approximation, can get a notion of how the data is structured and, through the very best visualization to represent the current data selection of interest, regarding spatio-temporality, get an overview of the dataset as a whole. This article presents a web approach to offer exploration tools of spatio-temporal data. This proposal is illustrated by a first prototype to show its technical feasibility and, a review of differents proposals is presented and how, based on its analysis, is structured this proposal and its future evaluation.",
