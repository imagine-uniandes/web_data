In particular, the DJI Mavic Pro drone was used, but the system is designed to work with any DJI brand drone. For this system, the user can choose from one of three simple geometric envelope models provided (plane, box, and cylinder) to represent the structure to be inspected. The system then plans the drone's flight path in order to ensure that the entire envelope model is covered in the inspection, and then the drone executes the flight autonomously. The system consists of two main software components: a ROS robotics application used for drone control and an Android application to enable communication with the drone using DJI Mobile SDK V4. The system was tested with the Gazebo simulator and the DJI Assistant 2 simulator to ensure its correct operation. Finally, it was tested in an experimental (real) scenario to inspect the front of a building, obtaining satisfactory results.",

That is why we implement path planning algorithms to generate the path for each of the robots. Finally, we implement evasion algorithms for manage dynamic scenarios.

Therefore, technologies that satisfy the proposed architecture are investigated and integrated. As part of the architecture, a robot is built using a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Kit for the execution of commands sent from the Web client. The basic functionality of the robot is implemented using the LeJOS API. There is an intermediate component that is responsible for receiving requests from the Web client and sending them to the robot to be executed.

One of the challenges Visual Analytics faces nowadays is the need to represent big amounts of information in a way that the user can explore. This large amount of data can not be managed by conventional machines and must be partitioned or underrepresented. Usually, visual analytics applications or widgets work with one single machine due to the requirements of low latency and quick interactions. This article presents Tadava, a visual analytics architecture based on representative sampling for large table-based datasets. Datasets samples are generated using systematics sampling and random sampling in order to obtain a collection of data from the original dataset. Experiments are made to determine the best sampling method to be used in datasets of different sizes, varying the step expected between samples. Tadava is built as a backend architecture for Navio, an interactive visualization widget for summarizing, exploring and navigating large datasets, and provides the widget with the capacity to manage table-based datasets between 400MB and 4GB.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of Adaptic with haptic retargeting, we conducted a within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to compare Adaptic to non-matching proxy objects (i.e., Styrofoam balls) and matching shape props. In our study, Adaptic sat on a desk in front of the user and changed shapes between grasps, to provide matching tactile feedback for various virtual objects placed in different virtual locations. Results indicate that the illusion was convincing: users felt they were manipulating several virtual objects in different virtual locations with a single Adaptic device. Docking performance (completion time and accuracy) with Adaptic was comparable to props without haptic retargeting.",

Using a triangle completionparadigm, we assessed the subjects’ spatial performance when devel-oping path integration tasks in two consumer-oriented displays (anHTC Vive and a GearVR) and two consumer-oriented interactiondevices (a Virtuix Omni Treadmill and a Touchpad Control). Ourresults show that when locomotion is available (treadmill condition),there exist signiﬁcant effects regarding the display and the path. Incontrast, when locomotion is mediated no effect was found. Somefuture research directions are therefore proposed.",

The whole development process took us from the conception of main game mechanics, coding, art, sounds and music. The development of the game was planned with the help of lean methodologies based on four main sprints that would tackle different problems in each one of them. Each sprint was composed of micro-sprints which were weekly meetings with our supervisor Pablo Figueroa. He helped us with feedback and improvements to be done throughout development.",

        "descripcion": "The interception of the action-perception loop in virtual reality [VR] causes that understanding the effects of different display factors in spatial perception becomes a challenge. For example, studies have reported that there is not size-constancy, the perceived size of an object does not remain constant as its distance increases. This phenomenon is closely related to the reports of underestimation of distances in VR, which causes remain unclear. Despite the efforts improving the spatial cues regarding display technology and computer graphics, some interest has started to focus on the human side. In this study, we propose a perceptual calibration method which can ameliorate the effects of non-size-constancy in heterogeneous VR displays. The method was validated in a perceptual matching experiment comparing the performance between an HTC Vive HMD and a four-walls CAVE system. Results show that perceptual calibration based on interpupillary distance increments can solve partially the phenomenon of non-size-constancy in VR.",

        "descripcion": "The Building Information Modelling (BIM) currently contributes to deeply modify the Architecture, Construction and Engineering (AEC) industry by improving data management, task planning, and architecture design etc. Nevertheless, other technologies have also joined this revolution, with the aim of allowing experts to perform better their tasks with them than with only the BIM, particularly mixed reality (MR). However, MR applications can take very diverse forms, because of the multiple design choice possibilities: multiple data sources from the BIM (3D model, worksite monitoring, simulations.. .), multiple possibilities of visualisations in MR (visual effects, 4D.. .) and multiple MR interactions (move, write, say, grasp.. .). Behind MR application design choices, there is a task for which the application has been created. Yet, having BIM-based MR environments that really allow to respond to the original need and that improve task performance is a current difficulty. In this paper, we present our proposal of a methodology for going from BIM to BIM-based mixed reality environments. Our inputs are the AEC tasks which are likely to benefit from being performed in a mixed reality environment, their performance measures (efficiency and effectiveness), and BIM data. Our target is to provide BIM-based mixed reality environments that support specific AEC tasks, and to prove thanks to appropriate indicators that the task performance has improved in MR compared to traditional methods. Thus, we present here the results from our first case studies and their impact on the methodology evolution. Finally, our ongoing and future works are discussed in the last sections",

Thanks to the flexibility of new web tools, we arrive to offer with S-PLOR-T a flexible and multi-screen web interface. Furthermore, we provide an architecture to allow to put coordinated visualizations, letting an analyst to have a clear notion of its data through interactions within the three main Wh* dimensions. With S-PLOR-T, the users will result in a customizable analysis in order to support the finding of new insights and support an effortless decision making with them. Additionally, our approach allows the user, not only to visual query any view, but to explore and to analyze multi-scale attributes within the space and the time. In this paper, we present a use case which was built and tested with domain experts in land use and mobility.",

To validate the model, the results were compared with previously proposed urban segregation models and the results were evaluated together with an expert in urban planning. In conclusion, a first version will be found, which, far from being able to be used in a decision support system, is useful because it allows to systematically see the behavior of the proposed agents under an urban and georeferenced context.",
