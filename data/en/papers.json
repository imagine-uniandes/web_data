As a result, the application is successfully built, which supports data structures such as linked lists, ordered binary trees, and graphs. In addition, a series of probable error cases are taken into account, for which management and information is provided to allow the student to correct their implementation.",

In particular, the DJI Mavic Pro drone was used, but the system is designed to work with any DJI brand drone. For this system, the user can choose from one of three simple geometric envelope models provided (plane, box, and cylinder) to represent the structure to be inspected. The system then plans the drone's flight path in order to ensure that the entire envelope model is covered in the inspection, and then the drone executes the flight autonomously. The system consists of two main software components: a ROS robotics application used for drone control and an Android application to enable communication with the drone using DJI Mobile SDK V4. The system was tested with the Gazebo simulator and the DJI Assistant 2 simulator to ensure its correct operation. Finally, it was tested in an experimental (real) scenario to inspect the front of a building, obtaining satisfactory results.",

That is why we implement path planning algorithms to generate the path for each of the robots. Finally, we implement evasion algorithms for manage dynamic scenarios. With those main challenges clear, we test these implementations on simulation and laboratory in order to measure the quality indicators of the proposed solution.",

Therefore, technologies that satisfy the proposed architecture are investigated and integrated. As part of the architecture, a robot is built using a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Kit for the execution of commands sent from the Web client. The basic functionality of the robot is implemented using the LeJOS API. There is an intermediate component that is responsible for receiving requests from the Web client and sending them to the robot to be executed. Finally, a demo application based on the proposed architecture is implemented that allows connection tests, execution of basic and complex commands.",

One of the challenges Visual Analytics faces nowadays is the need to represent big amounts of information in a way that the user can explore. This large amount of data can not be managed by conventional machines and must be partitioned or underrepresented. Usually, visual analytics applications or widgets work with one single machine due to the requirements of low latency and quick interactions. This article presents Tadava, a visual analytics architecture based on representative sampling for large table-based datasets. Datasets samples are generated using systematics sampling and random sampling in order to obtain a collection of data from the original dataset. Experiments are made to determine the best sampling method to be used in datasets of different sizes, varying the step expected between samples. Tadava is built as a backend architecture for Navio, an interactive visualization widget for summarizing, exploring and navigating large datasets, and provides the widget with the capacity to manage table-based datasets between 400MB and 4GB.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of Adaptic with haptic retargeting, we conducted a within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to compare Adaptic to non-matching proxy objects (i.e., Styrofoam balls) and matching shape props. In our study, Adaptic sat on a desk in front of the user and changed shapes between grasps, to provide matching tactile feedback for various virtual objects placed in different virtual locations. Results indicate that the illusion was convincing: users felt they were manipulating several virtual objects in different virtual locations with a single Adaptic device. Docking performance (completion time and accuracy) with Adaptic was comparable to props without haptic retargeting.",

Using a triangle completionparadigm, we assessed the subjects’ spatial performance when devel-oping path integration tasks in two consumer-oriented displays (anHTC Vive and a GearVR) and two consumer-oriented interactiondevices (a Virtuix Omni Treadmill and a Touchpad Control). Ourresults show that when locomotion is available (treadmill condition),there exist signiﬁcant effects regarding the display and the path. Incontrast, when locomotion is mediated no effect was found.

For example, studies have reported that there is not size-constancy, the perceived size of an object does not remain constant as its distance increases. This phenomenon is closely related to the reports of underestimation of distances in VR, which causes remain unclear. Despite the efforts improving the spatial cues regarding display technology and computer graphics, some interest has started to focus on the human side. In this study, we propose a perceptual calibration method which can ameliorate the effects of non-size-constancy in heterogeneous VR displays. The method was validated in a perceptual matching experiment comparing the performance between an HTC Vive HMD and a four-walls CAVE system. Results show that perceptual calibration based on interpupillary distance increments can solve partially the phenomenon of non-size-constancy in VR.",

However, MR applications can take very diverse forms, because of the multiple design choice possibilities: multiple data sources from the BIM (3D model, worksite monitoring, simulations.. .), multiple possibilities of visualisations in MR (visual effects, 4D.. .) and multiple MR interactions (move, write, say, grasp.. .). Behind MR application design choices, there is a task for which the application has been created. Yet, having BIM-based MR environments that really allow to respond to the original need and that improve task performance is a current difficulty. In this paper, we present our proposal of a methodology for going from BIM to BIM-based mixed reality environments. Our inputs are the AEC tasks which are likely to benefit from being performed in a mixed reality environment, their performance measures (efficiency and effectiveness), and BIM data. Our target is to provide BIM-based mixed reality environments that support specific AEC tasks, and to prove thanks to appropriate indicators that the task performance has improved in MR compared to traditional methods. Thus, we present here the results from our first case studies and their impact on the methodology evolution. Finally, our ongoing and future works are discussed in the last sections",

Currently, many procedures are trained in closed experiences that do not allow for human errors or interaction with real subjects or machinery. Our goal is to address this gap by using VR training tools for guided procedural learning. To achieve this, we applied an existing methodology for designing such systems, called ProtoColVR, to develop a VR training simulation prototype for emergency procedures within an engineering room on a ship. The simulator, called OPVSim, employs end-to-end instruction, including a VR controls tutorial, step-by-step guided training based on graphs, offering different paths to the same goal, with feedback on correct and incorrect actions. We conducted a study with two groups of participants-cadets in training and experienced officers-to assess the effectiveness of the system developed using the described methodology. The study results reveal positive trends, including increased knowledge scores after using the simulator, and favorable outcomes for the prototype in terms of usability, presence, and workload. We discuss our findings, limitations, and the implications for designing VR training systems for guided procedural learning.",

Through a distributed IoT architecture, the laboratory was equipped with an array of sensors to measure environmental variables (temperature, humidity, CO₂ levels, noise), occupancy, energy consumption, and computing equipment usage. All captured data is transmitted to a central platform where it is stored and used to drive both a web dashboard and an immersive AR application. The web dashboard allows real-time monitoring of metrics and historical data analysis through interactive graphs, while the AR interface projects contextual information onto the laboratory’s physical environment. This solution enables informed decision-making based on instantly updated data, anticipating adverse conditions (for example, overheating or poor air quality) and facilitating predictive maintenance actions. As a result, the laboratory’s safety, energy efficiency, and comfort were improved, while simultaneously generating a permanent record of its state.
